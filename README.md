# Test-for-a-Math-Agent-Solving-HLE-by-DeepSeek
Using the agent created by LinYang (https://github.com/lyang36/IMO25/blob/main/README.md), changing the module to DeepSeek v3 to solve HLE problems from Hugging Home (https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/hle)
When I try to run the code in GPU, I figured out that it really takes a long time(about 6 to 8 hours) to finish running an entire problem, but the result doesn't change between runs and errors. So in agent_ds.py, I changed the number of max_runs from 10 to 2 from the original agent as I found running 10 times does't affect the result "find no answer" or "find a correct answer" in attempting problem0001, problem0002 and the six imo problems in the initial github page. Additionally, I changed the times of errors that can end the cycle from 10 to 5.
In dataset.py I used HLE in Hugging Face website, to download it, I used a loacal path in my laptop, you can download the problem files directly from the repositary, or change the local path in the python file.
In test.py, the base command is fitted to the GPU cluster I used, to save the log files into your computer or GPU, be awared to change the file path.
When I ran the code in my laptop and in GPU cluster, the later one was only about 3 times faster, taking about 30-40 minutes per problem, I wonder if it's due to DeepSeek.
